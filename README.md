## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone the site.**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kdv24/QuickAPI.git

    ```

2.  **Clean up the clone.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and remove the package-lock.json.

    ```sh
    cd QuickAPI/
    rm package-lock.json
    ```

3.  **Start it up!**

    Stay in the siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    gatsby develop

    ```

    ```

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    ```

4.  **Troubleshooting**

    If you get a json error when you try to look at locahost:8000, try running `npm install` again now that you've removed the package-lock.json. Then start up the site again:

    ```sh
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```
